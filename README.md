# AV_Safety-Project


This project explores failures and disengagements in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) being tested on public
roads in California. I have used the California Department of Motor Vehicles dataset for this
project. I have done statistical and probabilistic analysis to evaluate how well the AI-driven decision and
control of AVs works under a variety of conditions and developing insights into why/how they
disengage.
As AVs have started interacting more directly with humans on public roads, the safety and resilience of
AVs is a significant concern (Uber’s [2] fatal accident, Tesla’s [3] autopilot flaw) and must be thoroughly
evaluated through analysis of data obtained during field-testing.
The California DMV mandates that all manufacturers testing AVs on public roads file annual reports
detailing disengagements and accidents. A disengagement occurs when a failure in the AV system
causes control of the vehicle to switch from software to the human driver.
In this project, I have studied the disengagement data from AV manufactures and analyzed the current
state of AV safety.
